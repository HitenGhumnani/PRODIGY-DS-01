For the visualisation of data I have used excel.

I have used my sample data which includes 100 people. The data is given in this repository by the name "sample data.xlsx"

Here I have used a bar chart.



**Steps to Create a Bar Chart in Excel**

1. Enter the Data:

- Open Excel and create a new sheet.
- Put the data into your Excel sheet.



2. Create a Pivot Table (to summarize the gender counts):
   
- Select the data range.
- Go to the "Insert" tab on the Ribbon.
- Click "PivotTable".
- Choose to place the PivotTable in a new worksheet or the existing worksheet.
- In the PivotTable Fields pane, drag the "Gender" field to both the "Rows" and "Values" areas. This will create a summary count of each gender.



3. Insert Bar Chart:
   
- Select the data in the PivotTable.
- Go to the "Insert" tab on the Ribbon.
- Click on the "Bar Chart" icon in the "Charts" group.
- Choose the type of bar chart you prefer.



4. Customize the Chart:   
- Chart Title: Click on the chart title to edit it.
- Axis Titles: Add axis titles by selecting the chart, going to the "Chart Tools" tab, and selecting "Add Chart Element" -> "Axis Titles".
- Labels and Colors: Customize labels, colors, and other chart elements as needed.
